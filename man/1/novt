.SH SYNOPSIS
.B novt
[

]
.I command ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Novt
is a terminal emulator mostly conforming to ecma-48, including color support.
It uses the shell to start
.IR command .
Keystrokes are written to the command and displayed along with characters read from the command.
Escape characters are interpreted.
Only the minimum number of escape codes are implemented (limited implementations are recommended by ecma-48).
.PP
Text is ``rendered'' in a Tk text widget.
The last lines are the current terminal contents, earlier lines can be scrolled to with the mouse (not with page up and page down!).
.PP
Bells are shown in the title bar.
Errors are also shown in the title bar, but the title bar background is colored red as well.

.SH BUGS
Terminals.
.PP
The `ICH' command, ``insert character'' does not move the cursor to the start of the line as ecma-48 dictates.
Programs do not expect this.
.PP
Lots of escape codes are not supported, they will be added as needed.
.PP
.I Novt
is slow.
