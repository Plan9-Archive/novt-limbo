novt \- terminal emulator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B novt
[
.B -de
]
.I command ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Novt
is a terminal emulator mostly conforming to ecma-48, including color
support.  It starts
.I command
and writes typed characters and escapes codes to it, and reads
characters from it, interpreting the escape codes.  Only the minimum
number of escape codes are implemented (limited implementations are
recommended by ecma-48!), only the escape codes that have been
encountered have been implemented.
.SS Terminal
Text is ``rendered'' in a Tk text widget.  The last lines are the
current terminal contents, earlier lines can be scrolled to with
the mouse (not with page up and page down!).  Text can be selected,
the current selection can be copied into the snarf buffer with
button 2, the snarf buffer can be pasted with button 3.
Copied text has spaces removed from the end of the line.
.PP
The buttons at the top of the screen have the following functionality:
.TP
.B exit
Close the program.
.TP
.B echo/noecho
Toggle echoing data written (characters typed).  The button's text
describes the function that will be enabled when clicked.  Option
.B -e
enables echo at startup.
.TP
.B escs/noescs
Toggle whether escape codes (those other than ascii control codes)
are interpreted are shown verbatim.
.TP
.B clear
Clear all text in the screen.
.TP
.B dim
Write current terminal dimensions to
.BR /dev/termctl .
.TP
.B debug
Increase debugging.  Option
.B -d
increases debugging at startup.
.B nodebug
Turns debugging of.
.PP
A ``bell'' is visualized between the ``exit'' and ``echo/noecho''
buttons with the text ``bell!''.
When the terminal is resized, the new dimensions are written to
.BR /dev/termctl ,
as exported by
.IR ssh (1).
This makes sure both sides talk about the same terminal dimensions.
.SS Options
.TP
.B -e
Echo the characters typed.  Disabled by default.
.TP
.B -d
Enable debug printing, more options prints more information.  
.SH EXAMPLE

.SH BUGS
Terminals.
.br
The `ICH' command, ``insert character'' does not move the cursor
to the start of the line as ecma-48 dictates.  Programs do not expect this.
.br
Lots of escape codes are not supported, they will be added as needed.
.br
.I Novt
is slow.
