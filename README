# status

first bits ready to try, lots to do.


# intro

a simple vt220 terminal emulator with colors.  some terminal features
will be missing.


# install

change the "mkconfig" if you do not have $ROOT set.  now "mk install"
to compile and install the files.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.

# todo

- fix color drawing.  we're keeping color state too often.
- implement scrolling regions

- handle horizontal tabs?
- implement switch to 132 columns?
- more keys to pass to remote, e.g. page up/down, insert, function keys.
- make drawing faster

- implement origin mode?
- implement arbitrary terminal dimensions?
- implement non-erasable characters?
- double height/width lines?  probably not
